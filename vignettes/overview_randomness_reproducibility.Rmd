Randomization: This package should be able to be run with no randomness. With default/simple parameters the following places randomize but can be overridden.

-   Generating train/est splits. Can be overridden by providing `tr_split`

-   Generating trtr/trcv splits. Can be overridden by providing `cv_folds`

-   Bumping samples. Can be overridden by providing list of samples for `bump_samples`

-   Estimation plans: Provide ones ( `lm_est(lasso=TRUE,...)` and `grid_rf`) use `cv_folds`. User-made ones should too.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(CausalGrid)
