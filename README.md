# Project

Tools for finding heterogeneous treatment effects (and means) based on
partitioning the covariate/feature space via full cross-cuts and solved
via greedy search. A typical usage would be analyzing an experiment to
find the high-level subgroups (a coarse partition that is useful to
humans) that differ in their estimated treatment effects.

This package is inspired by, and uses ideas from, [Causal
Tree](https://github.com/susanathey/causalTree) but aims to have the
partition be more interpretable and have better accuracy. It is slower,
though for high-level partitions this is usually not an issue.

This project is currently in an advanced prototype stage. Issues may
still be found in common usage. Please create issues for these!

## Installation

``` r
# install.package(devtools)
devtools::install_github("microsoft/CausalGrid")
```

## Usage

A simple example

``` r
# Generate some fake data
library(CausalGrid)
set.seed(1337)
N= 500 #Number of obsevations
K=3 #Number of features
X = matrix(runif(N*K), ncol=K) #Features for splitting partition
d = rbinom(N, 1, 0.5) #treatment assignment
tau = as.integer(X[,1]>.5)*2-1 #true treatment effect (just heterogeneous across X1)
y = d*tau + rnorm(N, 0, 1) #outcome

# Estimate a partition
est_part0 = fit_estimate_partition(y, X, d, cv_folds=2)
get_desc_df(est_part0) #summary table
#>            X1 N_est param_ests         pval
#> 1 <=0.5039703   121 -0.8322431 5.101454e-07
#> 2  >0.5039703   129  0.6494370 5.876865e-04
